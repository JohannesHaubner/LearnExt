Note:
    This model was by mistake trained using an L1 training-cost function
    and L2 validation-cost function. This is also reflected in the 
    convergence plot, the validation line shows L2 errors and is therefore
    much lower than for other networks trained on L1, who show the L1
    validation cost.
